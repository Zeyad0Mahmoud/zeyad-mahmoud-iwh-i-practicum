# Zeyad Mahmoud - Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations Practicum

This repository is for my HubSpot "Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations" Practicum submission.

---

## 🧠 Practicum Details

I created a private app in my HubSpot developer test account with the following permissions:

- crm.objects.contacts (read and write)

---

## 🧩 Object Used

Since custom objects are not available in my test account, I used the **Contacts** object instead, as allowed in the practicum instructions.

I created 3 records manually (example data):
1. Luna – Cat
2. Rocky – Dog
3. Kiwi – Parrot

---

## 🔗 Object List View

👉 [View my contacts in HubSpot](https://app-eu1.hubspot.com/contacts/147148041/objects/0-1/views/all/board)

## 📌 Notes

This practicum was completed following HubSpot’s guidelines:
> “If you don't have access to custom objects, you may use a standard object (contact, company, deal, etc.) to complete this practicum.”

All work was completed using a HubSpot Developer Test Account.
